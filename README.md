<p>Hi. My name is Jerry, a full stack developer from Los Angeles. My passion for developing applications started when <i>"I know there was better way to for this."</i> happened to me in high school. I had picked up coding when I was younger, but I didn't pursue it as a passion/career until later on. Now, I code everyday.</p>
